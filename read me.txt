1. How to run your code (what command-line switches they are, what happens when you
invoke the code, etc.)

    -There are different versions of Chromedriver, depending on operation system.
(This will be explained in detail at question 3 )
    -Firstly, install some module via: pip install -r requirements.txt
    -Run the code remotely: python YIN_JINGYING_hw7.py -source=remote
    -Run the code locally : python YIN_JINGYING_hw7.py -source=local

    what happens:
    if run remotely:
        -At first, it will scrap data from website
        -Then it will show the description of data, and some sample of data
        -Then we will draw some conclusion
            -it will show some description of data
            -At last, two figure will pop out, the first one should be closed to show the second.
            -These figures will save locally at the same fold,
            named - wordcloud.jpg and - conclusion.jpg

    if run locally:
        -At first, it will read data from local database
        -Then it will show the description of data, and some sample of data
        -Then we will draw some conclusion
            -it will show some description of data
            -At last, two figure will pop out, the first one should be closed to show the second.
            -These figures will save locally at the same fold,
            named - wordcloud.jpg and - conclusion.jpg


2. Any major “gotchas” to the code (i.e. things that don’t work, go slowly, could be
improved, etc.)

    The time when scrap data of publishers and songs might be long, please wait for few minutes.
    This can be improved by using crawler tools that support distributed cloud capture.

3. Anything else you feel is relevant to your project.

    -There is a chromedriver in this fold, but it only works for MAC
    -If this code is not run by MAC, Please install chromedriver of your operation system
    from website  http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
    -PLEASE MUST put the  chromedriver under this fold !!
    -please install chrome, to keep the code runs well
    -Install some module via: pip install -r requirements.txt
